Ramin Yazdani | GO Enrichment Analyzer | main | feat(init): Initial repository setup with basic README

Created foundational repository structure with initial README documenting the project's purpose: Gene Ontology enrichment analysis for Arabidopsis thaliana protein sets. This sets up the basic project documentation before adding configuration files.

The README provides a high-level overview of the GO enrichment analysis approach, establishing the project's direction for statistical analysis of overrepresented GO terms using Fisher's exact test.

Verified: README.md created with project overview and planned analysis approach.
