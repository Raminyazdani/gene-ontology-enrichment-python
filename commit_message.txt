Ramin Yazdani | GO Enrichment Analyzer | main | feat(stats): Add FDR multiple testing correction to GO enrichment

Enhanced the GO enrichment analysis with False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction for multiple testing, which is essential when testing hundreds of GO terms simultaneously. Without correction, many false positives would be reported due to the multiple comparisons problem.

Enhancements:
- Imported statsmodels.stats.multitest for FDR correction
- Applied Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction to p-values
- Added q-value (FDR-adjusted p-value) column to results
- Updated result presentation to show both p-values and q-values
- Added significance threshold interpretation (q < 0.05)

Statistical rationale:
- When testing 100+ GO terms, expect ~5 false positives at p < 0.05 by chance
- FDR correction controls the expected proportion of false discoveries
- More statistical power than family-wise error rate corrections (e.g., Bonferroni)
- Standard practice in genomics and bioinformatics enrichment analyses

Verified: FDR correction applied successfully, q-values calculated for all enriched terms.
