Ramin Yazdani | GO Enrichment Analyzer | main | feat(outputs): Add CD-HIT clustering results and visualizations

Added the clustering output files and visualization plots generated by the clustering analysis notebook. These results demonstrate the clustering behavior at different identity thresholds and provide representative sequences for downstream analysis.

Files added (code/content/):
- ex1.fasta: Original protein sequences (FASTA format)
- ex1_cluster_40.fasta through ex1_cluster_95.fasta: Clustered sequences at 40%, 50%, 70%, 90%, 95% identity
- ex1_cluster_*.fasta.clstr: CD-HIT cluster description files (5 files)
- ex1_cluster_*_barplot.png: Cluster size distribution visualizations (5 plots)

Results summary:
- Different thresholds produce different clustering granularity
- Higher identity thresholds retain more distinct sequences
- Visualizations show cluster size distributions at each threshold
- Representative sequences can be extracted for enrichment analysis

Purpose: Separating outputs from notebook code keeps version control manageable and allows tracking of generated results alongside analysis code.

Verified: 16 output files added (FASTA sequences, cluster files, and distribution plots).
