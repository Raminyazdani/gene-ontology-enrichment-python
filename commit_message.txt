Ramin Yazdani | GO Enrichment Analyzer | main | feat(portfolio): Add project identity and portfolio tracking documentation

Created comprehensive metadata files for project identity and portfolio documentation, achieving final portfolio-ready state. These files document the project's professional framing, transformation process, and complete change tracking.

Files created:
- project_identity.md: Professional project identity with display title, tagline, tech stack, problem statement, and GitHub topics/keywords
- report.md: Complete transformation log documenting all exploration, changes, and verification steps
- suggestion.txt: Issue ledger with 12 identified improvements, all marked STATUS=APPLIED
- suggestions_done.txt: Change ledger with detailed before/after snippets and file locators for all 10 applied changes

Project identity highlights:
- Display title: "GO Enrichment Analyzer for Arabidopsis"
- Focus: Statistical Gene Ontology enrichment analysis with Fisher's exact test and FDR correction
- Professional framing: Removed academic terminology (course codes, professor names, matriculation numbers)
- Portfolio-ready: Clear problem statement, approach, inputs/outputs

Transformation summary:
- Renamed notebooks: assignment_4_*.ipynb → go_enrichment.ipynb, clustering_analysis.ipynb
- Cleaned academic headers from notebooks
- Fixed brittle paths (absolute → relative with documentation)
- Enhanced README to portfolio standard
- Verified reproducibility (dependencies, data loading)

This represents the final polish that makes the project suitable for a professional portfolio, demonstrating software engineering best practices, clear documentation, and reproducible research.

Verified: All portfolio deliverables complete, project is portfolio-ready with professional presentation.
