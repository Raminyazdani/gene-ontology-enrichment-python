Ramin Yazdani | GO Enrichment Analyzer | main | feat(config): Add Python .gitignore for project

Added comprehensive .gitignore file to exclude Python cache files, Jupyter checkpoints, IDE configurations, and OS-specific files. This ensures clean version control by preventing temporary and generated files from being tracked.

Includes patterns for:
- Python bytecode and cache (__pycache__, *.pyc, *.pyo)
- Jupyter checkpoints (.ipynb_checkpoints/)
- Virtual environments (venv/, env/, .venv/)
- IDE files (.vscode/, .idea/, *.swp)
- OS files (.DS_Store, Thumbs.db)

Verified: .gitignore created with appropriate Python and Jupyter exclusions.
