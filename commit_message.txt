Ramin Yazdani | GO Enrichment Analyzer | main | WIP(analysis): Add GO enrichment analysis notebook (initial with path bug)

Implemented the main GO enrichment analysis notebook with Fisher's exact test for statistical enrichment detection. This notebook performs the core functionality of identifying overrepresented GO terms in the protein set.

Key features implemented:
- Loads protein set and GOA annotations
- Filters annotations (removes NOT qualifiers, IEA evidence codes)
- Separates GO terms by aspect (Biological Process, Molecular Function, Cellular Component)
- Calculates enrichment using Fisher's exact test (2×2 contingency table)
- Fetches GO term descriptions from QuickGO API
- Presents ranked results with p-values

Known issue: Uses absolute paths (/data/ex2.tsv, /data/goa_arabidopsis.tsv) which don't work across environments. This needs to be fixed in the next commit.

Status: WIP - paths need correction before notebook is fully functional.
