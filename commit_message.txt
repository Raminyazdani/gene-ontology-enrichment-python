Ramin Yazdani | GO Enrichment Analyzer | main | feat(fix): Fix data file paths in go_enrichment.ipynb

Fixed the data loading paths to use relative paths that work when running from the code/ directory. The previous version used absolute paths (/data/) from a local development environment that don't exist on other systems.

Changes:
- Changed `/data/ex2.tsv` → `./ex2.tsv`
- Changed `/data/goa_arabidopsis.tsv` → `./goa_arabidopsis.tsv`
- Changed `/data/quickgo_term_info.tsv` → `./quickgo_term_info.tsv`

This is a realistic hotfix for a common mistake - using absolute paths from a local environment that don't work elsewhere. The relative paths now work consistently when the notebook is run from the code/ directory as documented.

Verified: Notebook now loads all data files successfully when run from code/ directory. Data loads: 118 protein IDs, 158,988 GO annotations, 60 QuickGO terms.
