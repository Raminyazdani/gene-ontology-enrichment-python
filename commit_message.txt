Ramin Yazdani | GO Enrichment Analyzer | main | feat(clustering): Add CD-HIT sequence clustering analysis notebook

Created companion notebook for protein sequence clustering analysis using CD-HIT. This complements the GO enrichment analysis by helping identify redundant proteins before enrichment, which can affect statistical significance.

Key features:
- CD-HIT installation and setup instructions
- Clustering at multiple identity thresholds (40%, 50%, 70%, 90%, 95%)
- Cluster distribution analysis and visualization
- Representative sequence selection from each cluster

Analysis workflow:
1. Clone and build CD-HIT from source
2. Run clustering at different identity thresholds
3. Analyze cluster size distributions
4. Generate representative protein sets for downstream analysis

Use case: Removing redundant sequences before GO enrichment prevents bias from over-represented protein families and improves statistical validity of enrichment results.

Verified: Notebook structure complete with clustering workflow documented.
