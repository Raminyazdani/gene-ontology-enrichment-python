Ramin Yazdani | GO Enrichment Analyzer | main | feat(deps): Add requirements.txt with core dependencies

Defined all Python package dependencies needed for GO enrichment analysis and notebook execution. This ensures reproducibility and makes it clear what libraries are required.

Dependencies include:
- pandas (>=1.3.0): Data manipulation and analysis
- numpy (>=1.21.0): Numerical computations
- scipy (>=1.7.0): Fisher's exact test for enrichment
- statsmodels (>=0.13.0): FDR correction for multiple testing
- requests (>=2.26.0): QuickGO API interactions
- jupyter (>=1.0.0): Notebook environment

Verified: requirements.txt created with pinned minimum versions for stability.
