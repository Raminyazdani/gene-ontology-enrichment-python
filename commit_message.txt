Ramin Yazdani | GO Enrichment Analyzer | main | feat(data): Add GO annotation data and protein set

Added essential input data files for enrichment analysis, including protein sets and GO annotations from UniProt GOA database.

Files added:
- code/ex2.tsv: Curated set of 118 Arabidopsis thaliana protein IDs (UniProt format) for enrichment analysis
- code/goa_arabidopsis.tsv: Complete GOA annotations (~159k rows) containing GO term assignments for Arabidopsis proteins
- code/quickgo_term_info.tsv: GO term metadata including descriptions and hierarchical relationships

Data sources:
- GOA annotations: UniProt Gene Ontology Annotation database
- Protein set: Curated from experimental studies
- GO term info: QuickGO API metadata

Verified: 118 protein IDs, 158,988 GO annotation rows, 60 GO term metadata entries loaded successfully.
